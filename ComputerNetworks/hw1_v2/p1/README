ICN hw1(1) Calculator Server
Author: b06102020 楊晴雯
Usage:
	- Run socket_server.py and socket_client.py in respective terminals.
	- Basic Operations:  +, -, *, /, %, Python-supported:
		- input format: a operator b (whitespace separated,
				no whitespace at beginning)
		- 1 + 5
		- 3 * 7
		- 5 % 4
	- Linear Algebra Operations: matmul, dot, norm, determinant are written in LA.py.
	  	All input should be in INT, FLOAT due to parsing limitation.
		- input format: no whitespace at beginning, no whitespace in between elements within the vector/matrix
		- matmul: return the product matrix multiplication, whitespace separeated
			two list of lists with  * in between
			- [[12,7,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] * [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
			- note that the middle sizes should match
		- dot: return the inner product, whitespaces separated two lists with . in between
			- [5,0,0,0,0] . [0,0,0,0,0]
		- norm: return the norm of the vector, norm{space}{list}
			- norm [101,102,103]
		- det: return the determinant of a square matrix, set{space}{list of lists}
			- det [[5,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,-4],[0,0,3,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[0,-2,0,0,0]]
